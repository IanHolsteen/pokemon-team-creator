Thank you for checking out Pokemon Team Creator!

This application was created in conjunction with the PokeAPI in order to create a simple render of a pokemon's sprite, name, number, type, and statistics.

Furthermore, this application gives the user the ability to save pokemon to a team, with a limit of 6 pokemon. 

The primary way to use this app is by searching for a pokemon using the search bar, or pressing the random button next to the searchbar. This button features the ðŸŽ² emoji. 

Below the rendered 'pokemon card' is the button for saving pokemon to the team. Upon pressing this button 6 times, the button will be disabled. The button can be re-activated by deleting a pokemon either with the button featured next to that pokemon, or by fully resetting the team at the bottom of the page. 

There are two specific changes I can imagine to improve this application. 

I believe the color pallete can be greatly improved. I would also like to add a function that can check the type of the team against the weaknesses of the team's typing in total. I believe that this would add much more value to a user and could possibly make this project more that just a fun beginner's exercise. That being said, it was fun!

As this is the first application that I have built, I may not come back to it, though I do believe there are techniques that one could use to clean up the code. 

Please feel free to do absolutely whatever you want with this application and code.
